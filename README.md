- **Security**: Zero Trust models, pfSense firewalls, PKI with Vault, network segmentation
- **Automation**: n8n workflows, Python/PowerShell scripting, GitOps practices
- **Learning**: Continuous exploration of emerging technologies and best practices

## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### Enterprise-Grade Home Lab
A comprehensive multi-server infrastructure showcasing production-ready DevOps practices:

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **9-VLAN Network Design** with pfSense firewall segmentation
- **3-Node Proxmox Cluster** with 96TB ZFS storage
- **Zero Trust Security** using Keycloak SSO and HashiCorp Vault
